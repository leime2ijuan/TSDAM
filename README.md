This is the code related to the paper "TSDAM: A Time-Series Domain Adaptation Model for Building Energy Prediction under Data Scarcity."

The data folder contains the datasets used in this study, including weather files and electricity consumption files.

AdaptiveBILSTM.py and main.ipynb are the main code files for our model and its training process.

train_test_labels.json is used for categorizing electricity consumption data from different buildings for training and testing.

weather_labels.json provides the corresponding weather information for each building.

## Ablation Study - Multi-Scale Feature Extraction.ipynb and Ablation Study - Gaussian.ipynb are two notebooks for ablation experiments focusing on the core modules.

`data.ipynb` is the data preprocessing file.
